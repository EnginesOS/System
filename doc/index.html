<p>&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; Engines is a managed system of
containerised applications and services utilizing Docker, the system is
managed through a fully featured Rails based web front end. Application
images are built locally from public and or private blueprints, this is
done to ensure security and compatibility with the local environment and
local system services. The aim of Engines is to provide non technical end
users the ability to launch a machine (VM or BM) and install a collection
of business and/or personal servers on it with the same ease that a tablet
user adds applications, but with a finer grain of control on data access
and sharing.<br> &lt;p&gt; The use of blueprints and the associated image
build process provide the capacity to describe the installation and
configuration of a wide range of software, while maintaining both system
and data security. This coupled with the ease at which an end user can
install software from galleries, we envisage that the engines system will
suit: &lt;li&gt; Personal users who wish to maintain an online presence
with complete data sovereignty deploying packages like Mahara (eportfolio),
MediaGoblin, Ownstagram, publify .… &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Small Businesses
that wish to use a collection of packages, so they can have ERP Software,
blogging software, and additional packages on a single bill (or physical
host) with complete data sovereignty. There are several packages such as
Owncloud and Odoo that provide a rich feature set for work groups.
&lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt; Currently the only options available to end users to
make use of such packages are limited to SAS offerings or hiring a Linux
consultant to perform installations of an unknown quality and security.
&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Licensing and current status&lt;/strong&gt; The system is
currently in Alpha on a weekly release cycle with a planned Beta Release
due in August. The software is released under the Apache 2.0 license and is
available from <a
href="https://github.com/EnginesOS/System">github.com/EnginesOS/System</a>.
Some of the advanced features may be non functional as they are a work in
progress. We have an AWS AMI we can share. There is also a youtube video at
Currently there are about 25 applications available in our gallery. Some
require further input from the user to complete the installation via a
browser, though where possible the installation is automated. These
applications represent a range of applications and installation test cases,
the small number is not indicative in any way of the number of applications
that could be blueprinted with relative ease to run on the engines system.</p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt; The Engines system handles the
management and orchestration of services in support of engines that users
may install from galleries or custom definitions. The engine and service
containers are ephemeral with persistent data stores configured and linked
in by the system to maintain data and configuration persistence.
Applications are defined in blueprints we refer to these applications as
engines. We use a blueprint and build system so as to maintain control over
security and enforce a policy that no engine at any time runs as root
(including build time). Currently the engines system runs under Ubuntu, in
the future will will include support for other Linux flavours, through the
provision of additional templates and a base image &lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt; The services provide support to
applications, each service runs in it&#39;s own container, the default
installation includes, DNS, database servers, persistent file system,
scheduling, web router (nginx) outbound SMTP, volume sharing, backup,
logging and more. The system provides support for drop in third party
service containers through the use of runtime and service definition
configuration files. Services provided to containers can be persistent like
a database which is created before the container image is built or
ephemeral like a DNS record which only exists while the container is
running. The service definition templates describe the parameters required
to attach the service to an object type and to what object types the
service can be attached. The service images are kept on docker hub. Each
service is defined by two yamls files, one specifying the runtime
parameters for the service container, with the other yaml detailing for
what objects the service is applicable for and what are the required
parameters to attach this service. For example an FTP or NFS service can
only be applied to volume objects, while a backup can be applied to
engines, databases and volumes. The design is such that third party
services can be added through a docker image and the two fore mentioned
config files &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;User installed engines&lt;/strong&gt;
Installed engines can be web applications or server applications such as a
git daemon or a minecraft server. Engines are defined by blueprints
published in a public/private software gallery. Each engine runs in a
separate container, required services are registered and provisioned when
needed by the system service manager, as defined in the engine&#39;s
blueprint. Post installation, users can attach additional services to an
engine and it&#39;s component services. For example sharing a folder within
a persistent file service between engines or attaching sharing services
like NFS/FTP/SMBFS/ and drop box backing to a folder within a persistent
file service. When creating a blueprint the blueprint designer is required
to test the configurations persistence, so all engines are ephemeral.
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Management Applications &lt;/strong&gt; Rails based
web application that provides engine and service control and monitoring.
Command line utilities than mirror most of the functionality of the GUI, as
well as providing an additional command set suited for use in scripts. The
management suite and backend are independent of all other engines and their
services. The end result is a robust managed system that can bootstrap all
other services and engines. &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Engine
builder&lt;/strong&gt; The engines builder is launched from the web
management application. When a user chooses to install an application the
builder reads the blueprint and presents the user with a form of mandatory
and optional variables for them to enter. These variables are used to set
system parameters such as the external hostname for the web router, as well
as for use as variables in templates that are used to write relevant
configuration files for the target software and required services. In
addition to user entered variables, system variables and services
definition variables are available within the templates. Most packages can
be installed using defaults supplied by the system and blueprint. There is
a command line utility that can build an engine, but currently limited to
engines with no mandatory user input values defined in the blueprint. Blue
print design studio The blue print design studio is a Rails web application
available as a standalone application or engine. It is to be used by
developers and software porters to define and export blueprints for
software to be used in the Engines system. The blueprints produced can be
for local/in house use or to publish to a gallery server either for public
use or private use within a group. Gallery server This server provides a
listing service for blueprints, it doesn&#39;t serve the actual blueprints
but does serve the software&#39;s details including the licence under which
the software is published, along with the URI of the git repository holding
the blueprint. Future versions of the gallery will support, comments,
voting and licensed commercial software. The Gallery Server is and will
remain open source under the Apache 2 licence. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; Security is not merely achieved by
containerisation, containers run as non privileged users with restrictive
file permissions. Containers for applications are built from blueprints in
a way there is no scope for any external code to run as root during the
container build process or at runtime.  To provide flexibility to
developers and expert users will be able to load external Docker images and
configure mappings to system resources and create containers, on the
understanding that they trust the image they are using. Using this docker
image import function applications will be able to run as root if a user
chooses. &lt;p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;strong&gt;Blueprints &lt;/strong&gt; Applications are defined in
blueprints (in JSON) which are created in the Engines Blueprint Design
Studio. The blueprints can be hosted locally on the installation or
published in a public/private git repository and listed in open/private
galleries. Blueprints define every thing needed to install, configure and
secure an application. The blueprinting process is a codification of the
installation steps outlined in a software packages installation guide.
